				<p>I had the opportunity to participate in an Outward Bound Canada (OBC) expedition at the end of August 2021.
				With two OBC field leaders, eight participants, five canoes and twenty barrels, we paddled and camped for 14 days along the eastern coast of Georgian Bay.
				As someone who had minimal camping and canoeing experience prior to to the expedition, this was one of the most challenging things I have ever done and also one of the most rewarding.
				Although difficult at times, I had so much fun learning new skills, being in nature, and making life-long friends.

				The CCC is run by the Canadian Wildlife Federation (CWF) and funded by the Government of Canada through the Canada Service Corps program.
				The CCC program has 3 stages : Stage 1 is an OBC wilderness adventure, Stage 2 is a conservation field placement, and Stage 3 is a service porject in your home community.
